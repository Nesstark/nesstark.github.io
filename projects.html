                So this is the current website that you are on right now. It's hosted through GitHub pages.
                It contains all the information that I want out about myself. My CV, my projects and so on.
                It's very simple coded with HTML and CSS.

                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">A Night Out: Designing a Transformational Video Game to Promote Awareness Towards LGBTQ+ Violence</h4>
                This research paper explores the design of a transformational video game aimed at raising awareness about the violence faced by LGBTQ+ communities. 
                Through an engaging and impactful narrative, the game seeks to foster empathy and understanding by immersing players in experiences reflecting real-world challenges. 
                This innovative project demonstrates the potential of video games as tools for social change and education.

                This project was a part of the Image Processing course at Aalborg University.
                We students where tasked with making an opencv python game. It could be anything we wanted.
                I chose to create this small game, where you would control a rocket with your face, with face tracking from opencv.
                You would then travel the correct distance to the exosphere with the speed of one, spaceX's booster rockets.
